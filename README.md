# Weather-Box-V1
A small weather station for personal use. \
It displays the AQI using the neopixels, AQI threshold of each colour can be configured. \
It also shows probability of rain, I have personally configured it as red for rain and green for no rain but some psychopaths may like rain so they can do the opposite as well. \ 
It can perform data logging using Wi-Fi and your pc as a server. \
For power use a power bank or you can connect a 3v3 battery to the pins as well if u like that more. \
I have used 0805 package for the caps and resistors. <br>
