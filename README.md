# Weather-Box-V1
A small weather station for personal use
it displays the AQI using the neo pixel, AQI threshold of each colour can be configured 
it also shows probability of rain, I have personally configured it as red for rain and green for no rain but some psychopaths may like rain so they can do the opposite as well 
It can perform data logging using Wi-Fi and your pc as a server 
for power use a power bank or you can connect a 3v3 battery to the pins as well if u like that more 
i have used 0805 package for the caps and resistors
